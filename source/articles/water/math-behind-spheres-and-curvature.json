We wish to find the height (h) which is the drop in curvature over the distance (d). Using the circumference we find that 1 kilometer has the angle 360° / 40 030 km = 0.009°. The angle (a) is then a = 0.009° * distance (d). The derived formula h = r * (1 - cos a) is accurate for any distance (d).</p>",
